1. Introduction:



The restauraunt Business Is one of the meanest cut throat business's in the world as of today. 
There are so many competing establishments that it's almost impossible for store owners to 
keep there doors open. Through the healp of data I will hopefully show how owners can use
this tool of pulling data so they can keep their new store open for many years to come in the 
future by opening there establishments in the wealthiest and most pupulous area in toronto.

2. Data Acquisition

I took my data from an online consensus from 2016.

3. Exploratorty Data Analysis and Results

Through the data of the 2016 toronto concensus I have found a variety of options for cities to open
a restauraunt. On the one hand i found that not neccesarrily did the city with the most people had the greatest amount of income.
Suprisingly Bridle Path-Sunnybrook-York Mills which has	9,266 people put out a whopping	$308,010 whereas cities like 
Rouge had 46,496 people and put out a miniscule	$39,556. Therefore if the store owners wanted to move they didnt have to worry
about how many people would be coming into their estabnlishments but rather the consumption intake.

4. Discussion section

From the data I Collected I actually noticed that a popultation size of 20,000 or less actually had an average income
of 100,000 to 150,000. This is very surprising because the cities with larger populous wouldve been a terribble investment
on the owners behalf. Its very interesting how from simple data census it could save the welfare of these businness owners.

5. Conclusion

On conclusion using simple data extraction such as income and populous size in toronto would help
make restauraunt establishments not only last longer but rake in the dough.
